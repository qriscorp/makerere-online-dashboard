# Makerere Online University Management System

A comprehensive web-based university management platform built with React, designed to support academic administration, online learning, student enrollment, examinations, certification, virtual learning, tutoring, and financial transactions.

**Live URL:** https://makerereonlineschool.com

## Tech Stack

- React 19 + TypeScript
- React Router DOM v7
- Tailwind CSS v4 (Makerere-inspired theme: crimson, gold, cream)
- shadcn/ui component library
- Recharts (data visualization)
- React Hook Form + Zod (form validation)
- Sonner (toast notifications)
- Vite (build tool)

## Getting Started

### Local development (recommended)

1. Start the API and database:

```bash
cd ../makerere-online-api
docker compose up --build -d
```

2. Configure the dashboard to use the local API:

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3434
npm install
npm run dev            # http://localhost:8080
```

### Full stack with Docker

From the project root (`makerere project/`):

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
# Dashboard: http://localhost:3535
# API:       http://localhost:3434
```

Or dashboard only (expects API already running on port 3434):

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
# Available at http://localhost:3535
```

## User Roles

The system supports 4 user roles, each with a dedicated sidebar navigation and role-specific views:

| Role | Access Level |
|------|-------------|
| Super Admin | Full system access, manages admins, API configs, analytics |
| Admin | Creates schools, courses, intakes, lecturers, approves course units |
| Lecturer | Creates course units, uploads materials, schedules lectures, creates exams, offers tutoring |
| Student | Registers, enrolls, pays, attends classes, takes exams, downloads certificates |

Use the **role switcher** in the dashboard header to switch between roles during development.
